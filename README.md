## AR-Hidden-Object-Game

### Intro - Why I built this app
There is a constant disconnect between museum goers and the art. Curators of museums find this to be a huge problem today. They say that museum goers seem to be distracted or uninterested. Because of technology advancement, today people are constantly distracted with their cellphones or they are totally uninterested in what is happening outside of their device. Therefore, the FIRE-PVC program is coming up with ways we can incorporate technology to enhance the museum goers experience. 

Over the last few months, I have created a find the difference game where the user compares the altered image on the screen to the original painting in front of them. The app that I generated will help users become more interested and excited about art, especially those under the age of 12. This age group was the main target during development. However, I tested this app with all age groups. The results displayed that the app successfully promotes a thorough analysis of the paintings while also creating a sense of enjoyment. 

### What does it do?
I created a “find the differences” game that has 3 paintings for the user to play on. Each painting has 3 differences than the actual painting in front of them. Once s difference is found, a short explanation about the importance of this part of the painting is displayed to the user. I have also provided 3 hints to each painting; one hint corresponding to each difference. If the user needs a hint, they can click the button and the scene shifts to the camera view. In order to see the hint, the user must place the painting in the view and square frame will highlight the area the difference can be found. The exit button will take them back to the 2D painting where they will be able to continue. If the difference is found, then its corresponding hint will be destroyed. The difference is also saved at the bottom of the screen next to the points which is out of 3.
